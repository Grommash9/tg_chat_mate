This project was created by me to learn frontend and Docker. During the development, I decided to make the code open to share experience and knowledge with other developers and gain experience in task delegation.

The project's goal is to develop a solution for technical support of users or clients who can contact your business through a Telegram bot. Inquiries from these individuals will be directed to a web panel where you and other managers can respond to user questions.

All services are in a single repository for quick deployment on client servers. One of our goals is to make the project convenient and easy to deploy without compromising its qualities.

We are extremely welcoming to new contributors!
